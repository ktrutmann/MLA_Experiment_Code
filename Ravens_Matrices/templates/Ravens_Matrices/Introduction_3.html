    <p>         
    As you could see in the previous example, the pictures can differ in multiple aspects:<br>
    Shape, size, color, direction, border and markings in the corner.</p>

    <p>
    There are multiple ways in which these aspects can change within the grid of pictures.
    In the previous example, the difference was between rows, as is shown in the picture below.</p>

    <img src="{% static "RPM/Bsp_Zeile.png" %}"/>
    <br /><br />

    The aspects can however also change column-wise, <br />
    <img src="{% static "RPM/Bsp_Spalte.png" %}" /> <br /><br />
    diagonally, <br />
    <img src="{% static "RPM/Bsp_Diagonale.png" %}"/> <br /><br />
    or in the corners.<br />
    <img src="{% static "RPM/Bsp_Ecken.png" %}"/> <br /><br />
