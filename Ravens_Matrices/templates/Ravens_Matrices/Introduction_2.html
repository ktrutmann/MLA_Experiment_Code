How does the Matrix Task Work?
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
     <p>
     A matrix task consists of a 3x3 table containing pictures which are arranged in a pattern.
     However, the picture in the lower right corner is missing.
     You have to identify the missing picture.
     Some matrix tasks are relatively easy, such as the one below.
     </p>

    <br />

    <p>
    In this example the shape remains constant in each row but differs between rows.
    Notice that the border around each shape is the same.
    You are given multiple possible answers and have to identify the letter corresponding to the correct one.
    If given the options below, the correct answer would be 'c' as it has the correct shape, orientation and border.

    <p>
    Option 'a' is incorrect because the triangles in the corners are pointing in the wrong direction.
    Option 'b' is incorrect because it has the wrong shape.
    Option 'd' is incorrect because the shape has the wrong color.
    Option 'e' is incorrect because it has the wrong size.
    Option 'f' is incorrect because the shape is rotated in the wrong way.
    Option 'g' is incorrect because the border is a solid line.
    Option 'h' is incorrect because it also has the wrong color.
