    <p>
        The tasks can be rather difficult, as for example the one below.
        It is okay to guess and you should consider that you are given four and a half minutes.

    <p>
        In this example the missing picture should have a light brown dashed border because this aspect 
        changes in every row.
        The markings in the corner should be black triangles because this aspect changes in the corners of the grid
        (and hence the diagonal spanning from the upper left to the lower right corner has the same border markings).
        The shape should be big because that aspect changes in every column.
        The shape should be a trident, because this aspect changes in the corners
        (here the diagonal from the upper right to the lower left stays constant).
        The shape shoule be black because the color changes in the diagonal.
        The teeth of the trident should face upwards because the direction also changes in the diagonal
        (see the upper left corner of the grid).
        Hence, option 'f' is the correct one.
