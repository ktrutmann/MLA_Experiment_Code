<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment. <br>
    The following are your earnings during the task:</p>
    <table id="feedback_table" style="text-align:center; width: 600px; background: aliceblue;">
        <tr style="background: skyblue">
            <th>Block</th><th>Earnings</th>
        </tr>
        {% for this_trade_payoff in payoff_list %}
            {% if forloop.counter == wining_block %}
                <tr style="background: darkgreen">
            {% else %}
                <tr>
            {% endif %}
                <td>{{ forloop.counter }}</td><td>{{ this_trade_payoff }}</td>
            </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>
    <p><br>
        The block which was randomly chosen to determine your payoff is
        <span style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">marked in green</span>.<br>
        You therefore have earned <b>{{ wining_earnings }}</b> in the investment task.
        In addition, you have earned <b>{{ ravens_bonus_points|c }}</b> in the matrix task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your payoff is now calculated in the following way:
    </p>
    <p>
        {{ showup_fee }} for completing the study + ${{ base_payoff }} base bonus + {{ percent_conversion }}% of
        {{ wining_earnings }} from the investment task and {{ percent_conversion }}% of {{ravens_bonus_points|c }}
        from the matrix task = <b>{{ payoff_total }}</b><br>
        (In case the math does not seem correct here, note that you can lose no more from the investment task than the
        ${{ base_payoff}} base bonus and that the points from the matrix task may have to be rounded.)
    </p>
    <!-- TODO: (2) Make clearer what will be payed out when -->
    <p>
        If you have activated fullscreen mode you may now leave it by pressing <b><i>F11</i></b>
        or <i><b>Cmd + Ctrl + F</b></i> again. <br>
