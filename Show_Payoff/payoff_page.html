<p>Thank you for participating in this experiment. <br>
    The following are your earnings during the task:</p>
    <table id="feedback_table" style="text-align:center; width: 600px; background: aliceblue;">
        <tr style="background: skyblue">
            <th>Block</th><th>Earnings</th>
        </tr>
        {% for this_trade_payoff in payoff_list %}
            <tr>
                <td>{{ forloop.counter }}</td><td>{{ this_trade_payoff }}</td>
            </tr>
        {% endfor %}
        <tr style="background: skyblue;">
            <td>Total:</td><td>{{ end_cash_sum }}</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        <br>
        You therefore have earned <b>{{ end_cash_sum|c }}</b> in the investment task.
    <p>
        In addition, you have earned {{ ravens_bonus_points|c }} in the matrix task.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your payoff is now calculated in the following way:
    </p>
    <p>
        {{ showup_fee }} for completing the study +  ${{ base_payoff }} base bonus + {{ percent_conversion }}% of
        {{ end_cash_sum|c }} from the investment task and {{ percent_conversion }}% of {{ravens_bonus_points|c }}
        from the matrix task = <b>{{ payoff_total }}</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have activated fullscreen mode you may now leave it by pressing <b><i>F11</i></b>
        or <i><b>Cmd + Ctrl + F</b></i> again. <br>
        Your completion code for this study is <b>{{ completion_code }}</b>.
        This code is used to confirm that you finished the study.
        Thank you very much for participating!
    </p>
