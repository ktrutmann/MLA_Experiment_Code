# Tutorial for the Trading Task
Make sure to set the variables in `models.py` to the same as those in the actual app!
The instructional texts displays those variables, so participants would be misinformed
if they are not the same!

## "Hardcoded" variables
The instruction text contains the price movements as fixed text.
These are steps of 5, 10 and 15. If you want to change these, you have
to change the text as well as the hardcoded updated return in the table.

## Exported Data
The exported data of the tutorial is similar to that of the main task.
However, some variables are not recorded,
while other additional variables might also be of interest:

- `Q1`, `Q2` and `Q3` are the answers given to the quiz.
- `wrong_answers` indicates how many wrong answers were given during the quiz.

## Quiz Answers
Participants can only continue after answering each question in the quiz
correctly. The following are the correct answers (ranging from 1 to 3):

**Q1: 3<br>Q2: 2<br> Q3: 1<br> Q4: 2<br> Q5: 3<br> Q6: 3**
